Hello! My name is Mark, I'm an aspiring web developer who creates modern, responsive, and fast websites. I'm 12 years old, but I've already made several websites and I'm constantly learning new things. I'm fluent in HTML, CSS, a little bit of JavaScript, and I'm actively learning new technologies.

My goal is to become a top freelancer in web development, helping people create cool websites and realize their own ideas.

If you need a simple and stylish website, write to me, I will do it quickly and efficiently!
